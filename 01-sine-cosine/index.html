        <p>
          You may have been taught in school that "sine" or "cosine" are something to do with calculating the angles
          inside a triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe you were just in the room when mathematics was being taught&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the heart of the matter is that this right-angled triangle you learnt about in school is simply a tool for
          understanding rotation and is constructed inside a circle where the triangle's longest side is the circle's
          radius.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this, let's draw a circle with a radius of one unit whose centre (point `O`) is located at the
          origin of some coordinate system. Next, we mark a point `C` where the circumference of the circle crosses the
          positive X axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as point `C` rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, we can see that a right-angled triangle is formed
          within the circle whose width is the distance between point `C` and some point `W` projected onto the Y axis,
          and whose height is the distance between point `C` and some point `H` projected onto the X axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          As point `C` moves around the circle, point `W` moves up and down the Y axis, and point `H` moves left and
          right along the X axis. The key point to understand here is that the height (line `CH`) and width (line `CW`)
          change in a fixed ratio that is directly proportional to the angle of rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graphs to the right of and below the circle trace a wave shape that describes how the height and width of
          the triangle vary with the angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also notice that a sine wave and a cosine wave have exactly the same shape; the only difference being that
          when the angle is zero, the sine wave has a value of zero, but the cosine wave has a value of one.

        <h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>
        <p>
          If we divide the height `CH` or the width `CW` of the triangle by the length of the radius `OC`, we obtain a
          fraction that exactly represents the angle of rotation. Also this relationship is a two-way street. If we know
          the angle, we can work out the ratio, and if we know the ratio, we can work out the angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trigonometric functions are simply the names given to these ratios.
        </p>

        <h3>Sine</h3>
        <p>"Sine" is the name given to the ratio of the height `CH` of the triangle to the radius `OC` of the
          circle. This value varies in the range `-1..+1`.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an exact relationship between the angle &theta; and the ratio of height to radius.
          So when we use the function `sin(&theta;)`, we are really calculating
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mfrac>
              <mtext>height</mtext>
              <mtext>radius</mtext>
            </mfrac>
          </math>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have arbitrarily defined our circle to have a radius of one, the sine of the angle is simply the
          height of the triangle.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if we know the sine value of an angle, we can turn that fraction back into an angle using the
          inverse sine function: `&theta; = sin^-1 (value)`. (Also written `arcsin()`)
        </p>

        <h3>Cosine</h3>
        <p>"Cosine" is the name given to the ratio of the width `CW` of the triangle to the radius `OC` of the
          circle. This value varies in the range `-1..+1`.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an exact relationship between the angle &theta; and the ratio of width to radius.
          So when we use the function `cos(&theta;)`, we are really calculating
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mfrac>
              <mtext>width</mtext>
              <mtext>radius</mtext>
            </mfrac>
          </math>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have arbitrarily defined our circle to have a radius of one, the cosine of the angle is simply the
          width of the triangle.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if we know the cosine value of an angle, we can turn that fraction back into an angle using the
          inverse cosine function: `&theta; = cos^-1 (value)`. (Also written `arccos()`)
        </p>

        <h3>Tangent</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, "tangent" is the name given to the ratio of the triangle's height `CH` to its width `CW`. The tangent
          value varies in the range `-&infin;..+&infin;`.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we know the angle &theta;, then the value known as `tan(&theta;)` can be obtained by calculating
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mfrac>
              <mtext>height</mtext>
              <mtext>width</mtext>
            </mfrac>
          </math>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if we know the tangent value of an angle, we can turn that value back into an angle using the
          inverse tangent function: `&theta; = tan^-1(value)` (Also written `arctan()`)
