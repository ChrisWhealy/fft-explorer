        <h2>Phase</h2>
        <p>
          The sine and cosine waves are an examples of "periodic functions".
        </p>
        <p>
          To say that something is "periodic" means that it does the same thing over and over again.
          For example, the hands on a clock are periodic &mdash; they just go round and round pointing at the same 12
          hours over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          To say that a mathematical function is periodic means that no matter what sequence of numbers you put into it,
          it will give you back a corresponding set of numbers that form a never ending cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first lesson <a href="/sine-cosine/index.html">Where do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a>, we saw
          how a wave can be generated by tracing how the distance of a point on the circumference of a circle changes in
          relation to the X and Y axes, as that point spins around forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          How far up or down a wave is in this cycle is known as the wave's <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)" targe="_new">phase</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Phase Shift as Degrees</h2>
        <p>
          If we take the horizontal and vertical graphs from the first lesson and lay them on top of each other, we'll
          get the graph shown below, where the green wave is the sine and the blue wave is the cosine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the sine wave first crosses the X axis at 0&deg;, but the cosine wave crosses the X axis at
          90&deg;.
          So we can say that the cosine wave is offset from the sine wave by 90&deg;.
        </p>
        <p>
          This offset is known as a "phase shift".
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, we can see two sine waves that are offset from each other by 90&deg;.

          But just a minute&hellip; &nbsp;The blue "sine" wave looks exactly like the cosine wave we saw on the previous
          graph&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you move the "Phase shift" slider over to the far left, then you can see that the blue wave now lines up
          exactly with the
          green wave.
          This is because compared to a sine wave, a cosine wave always has a phase shift of 90&deg;.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we now think of the blue wave above as a cosine wave instead of a sine wave, then we can see that:<br>
          <br>
          `sin(&theta; + 90) = cos(&theta;)`<br>
          or<br>
          `cos(&theta; - 90) = sin(&theta;)`

        <h2>Phase Shift as Time</h2>
        <p>
          Another way to think of phase shift is in terms of time &mdash; one wave is offset from another by a certain
          number of milleseconds. However, in order to express phase shift in terms of time, we need to know how rapidly
          that wave is going up and down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first lesson <a href="/sine-cosine/index.html">Where do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a> we saw a
          point rotating around the circumference of a circle in an anti-clockwise direction.
          Now need to know how fast that point is going around.
        </p>
        <p>
          This speed of oscillation is known as the wave's "frequency" and it has the unit `Hz` named after the German
          physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz">Heinrich Hertz</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say that this point is spinning around the circle 100 times per second: that is, one rotation every 10
          milleseconds.
          So on the graph above, the horzontal axis displays degrees of rotation (from 0&deg; to 360&deg;), but we now
          know that scale can also represent time &mdash; in our example, 0&deg; to 360&deg; equals 10 milleseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we know for a wave of a particular frequency `f`, that it has rotated through an angle &theta;, then we
          can calculate how much time that took using the formula:<br>
          `t=&theta;/(f xx 360&deg;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we could rearrange this formula to calculate the angle `&theta;` given the frequency `f` and the
          time `t`:<br>
          `&theta;=t xx f xx 360&deg;`

        <h2>The Non-Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
        <p align="center">
          <i>"The square on the hypotenuse has an area equal<br>to the sum of the squares on the other two sides"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although no writings of Pythagoras have ever been discovered, by the Late Roman Period, he was already held in
          high regard as a philosopher and mathematician.
          Consequently, the discovery of this relationship had already been attributed to him in spite of the fact that
          it had been widely known for at least 1000 years before Pythagoras' birth.
          One of the earliest documents known to record this relationship is the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Papyrus_6619" target="_new">Berlin Papyrus 6619</a> written in
          Ancient Egypt
          during the 13th Dynasty (1990 - 1800 BC).
        </p>
        <p>
          All that to say, as you drag point `C` around the circle, you'll see that the sum of areas of the two green
          squares always equals the area of the blue square.

        <h2>The Origin of a Trigonometric Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Since we have decided to assign this circle a radius of one unit, the definitions of <code>sin(&theta;)</code>
          and <code>cos(&theta;)</code> can be reduced simply to <code>sin(&theta;) = height</code> and
          <code>cos(&theta;) = width</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that the areas of the various squares shown above will be:
        <ul>
          <li>The area of the square on the radius (the hypotenuse) is always equal to 1</li>
          <li>The area of the square opposite the angle is always equal to <code>height<sup>2</sup></code> which is the
            same as
            <code>sin(&theta;)<sup>2</sup></code>
          </li>
          <li>The area of the square adjacent to the angle is always equal to <code>width<sup>2</sup></code> which is
            the same as
            <code>cos(&theta;)<sup>2</sup></code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        We now have a simple, visual demonstration of the trigonometric identity
        <code>sin(&theta;)<sup>2</sup> + cos(&theta;)<sup>2</sup> = 1</code>.
