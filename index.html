      <h3><a href="./sine-cosine/index.html">Where Do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a></h3>
      <p>
        You were probably taught in school that the trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine and tangent
        describe the relationship between the angles and the lengths of the sides in a right-angled triangle.
        Whilst this explanation is perfectly correct, it doesn't quite get down to the heart of the matter.

      <h3><a href="./phase-shift/index.html">Phase and Phase Shift</a></h3>
      <p>
        In the previous example, you probably noticed that a sine wave and a cosine wave have exactly the same
        shape.<br>
        The only difference is that <code>sin(0&deg;) = 0</code>, but <code>cos(0&deg;) = 1</code>.<br>
        This difference is known as a phase shift.
