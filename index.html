  <h1>A Gentle Introduction to Understanding The Fourier Transform</h1>
  <h2>Understanding the Tools</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/01-sine-cosine/index.html">Where Do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a></h3>
      <p>
        You were probably taught in school that the trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine and tangent
        describe the relationship between the angles and the lengths of the sides in a right-angled triangle.
        Whilst this explanation is perfectly correct, it doesn't quite get down to the heart of the matter.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/02-phase-shift/index.html">Phase and Phase Shift</a></h3>
      <p>
        In the previous example, you probably noticed that a sine wave and a cosine wave have exactly the same
        shape.<br>
        The only difference is that <code>sin(0&deg;) = 0</code>, but <code>cos(0&deg;) = 1</code>.<br>
        This difference is known as a phase shift.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/03-amplitude/index.html">Amplitude</a></h3>
      <p>
        We have already spoken about two of a wave's three fundamental properties: frequency and phase.
        Now we'll look at the third fundamental property, amplitude.
      </p>
    </li>

      <h3><a href="./01-tools/04-non-pythagorean/index.html">The Non-Pythagorean Theorem</a></h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <i>"The area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to<br>the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two
          sides"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement has been drummed into students for the last two millenia, and they have always been taught that
        it was the Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras who first came up with this theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theorem is perfectly correct, but it was discovered at least 1000 years before Pythagoras was born&hellip;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/05-radians/index.html">Radians: Another Way To Measure Angles</a></h3>
      <p>
        We are used to measuring angles in degrees, but in physics and engineering, another unit of rotation is used
        called the radian.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/06-euler/index.html">Euler's Number</a></h3>
      <p>
        In addition to `pi`, there's another mathematical constant that keeps popping up (sometimes when you least
        expect it) called `e`.
      </p>
      <p>
        In keeping with `pi`, it is impossible to calculate the exact value of `e`; but in spite of this limitation of
        precision, we need to understand how such a number is derived, because this will open the door to understanding
        other values we have already encountered.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./01-tools/07-maclaurin/index.html">Maclaurin Series</a></h3>
      <p>
        The infinite series used to calculate `e^x` is an example of a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Maclaurin" target="_new">Maclaurin</a> series.
        Many other values can be calculated using a Maclaurin series, but the two that are of particular interest to
        us are the series for calculating sine and cosine.
      </p>
    </li>

      <h3><a href="./01-tools/08-imaginary/index.html">Imaginary Numbers</a></h3>
      <p>
        When you multiply a number by itself, you are "squaring" that number.
        Reversing this process is called "taking the square root".
        The point here is that when you square any of the normal counting numbers, the answer will always be positive:
      </p>
      <p>
        But what happens if you need to find the square root of a negative number?
        Its seems that this simple question causes mathematics to break.
      </p>
    </li>

      <h3><a href="./01-tools/09-euler-formula/index.html">Euler's Formula and Identity</a></h3>
      <p>
        We will now combine what we've learnt about using Maclaurin series to express the values of `e^x`,
        `sin(&theta;)` and `cos(&theta;)`, with what we've learnt about the cycle of values created we raising `i` to
        various integer powers to derive firstly, Euler's Formula, and secondly, Euler's famous Identity.

      <h3><a href="./01-tools/10-complex-nums/index.html">Complex Numbers</a></h3>
      <p>
        Now that we have encountered this <i>strange-but-very-important-number-that-you-cannot-count-to</i> called `i`
        or `sqrt
        (-1)`, we need to look at performing arithmetic using `i`.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="./01-tools/11-complex-arith/index.html">Arithmetic with Complex Numbers</a></h3>
      <p>
        We will now take a look at performing arithmetic using complex numbers.

  <h2>The Fourier Series</h2>

    <li>
      <h3><a href="./02-fs/01-convolution-intro/index.html">Convolution</a></h3>
      <p>
        Convolution is a process of fundamental importance as it helps us to discover the individual frequencies from
        which a signal is composed.
