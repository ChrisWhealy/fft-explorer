  <p>Some introductory explanations for understanding the The Fourier Transform</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="./sine-cosine/index.html">Where Do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a></h3>
      <p>
        You were probably taught in school that the trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine and tangent
        describe the relationship between the angles and the lengths of the sides in a right-angled triangle.
        Whilst this explanation is perfectly correct, it doesn't quite get down to the heart of the matter.

      <h3><a href="./phase-shift/index.html">Phase and Phase Shift</a></h3>
      <p>
        In the previous example, you probably noticed that a sine wave and a cosine wave have exactly the same
        shape.<br>
        The only difference is that <code>sin(0&deg;) = 0</code>, but <code>cos(0&deg;) = 1</code>.<br>
        This difference is known as a phase shift.

      <h3><a href="./amplitude/index.html">Amplitude</a></h3>
      <p>
        We have already spoken about two of a wave's three fundamental properties: frequency and phase.
        Now we'll look at the third fundamental property, amplitude.

      <h3><a href="./non-pythagorean/index.html">The Non-Pythagorean Theorem</a></h3>
      <p align="center">
        <i>"The area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to<br>the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two
          sides"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement has been drummed into students for the last two millenia, and they have always been taught that
        it was the Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras who first came up with this theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theorem is perfectly correct, but it was discovered at least 1000 years before Pythagoras was born&hellip;

      <h3><a href="./radians/index.html">Radians: Another Way To Measure Angles</a></h3>
      <p>
        We are used to measuring angles in degrees, but in physics and engineering, another unit of rotation is used
        called the radian.
