        <h2>The Non-Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
        <p align="center">
          <i>"The area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to<br>the sum of the areas of the squares on the other
            two sides"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although no writings of Pythagoras have ever been discovered, by the Late Roman Period, he was already held in
          high regard as a philosopher and mathematician.
          Consequently, the discovery of this relationship had already been attributed to him in spite of the fact that
          it had been widely known for at least 1000 years before his birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the earliest documents known to record this relationship is the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Papyrus_6619" target="_new">Berlin Papyrus 6619</a> written in
          Ancient Egypt during the 13th Dynasty (1990 - 1800 BC).
        </p>
        <p>
          All that to say, as you drag point `C` around the circle, you'll see that the sum of the areas of the two green
          squares always equals the area of the blue square.

        <h2>The Origin of a Trigonometric Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Since we have decided to assign this circle a radius of one unit, the definitions of <code>sin(&theta;)</code>
          and <code>cos(&theta;)</code> can be reduced simply to <code>sin(&theta;) = height</code> and
          <code>cos(&theta;) = width</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that the areas of the various squares shown above will be:
        <ul>
          <li>The area of the square on the radius (the hypotenuse) is always equal to 1</li>
          <li>The area of the square opposite the angle is always equal to <code>height<sup>2</sup></code> which is the
            same as
            <code>sin(&theta;)<sup>2</sup></code>
          </li>
          <li>The area of the square adjacent to the angle is always equal to <code>width<sup>2</sup></code> which is
            the same as
            <code>cos(&theta;)<sup>2</sup></code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        We now have a simple, visual demonstration of the trigonometric identity
        <code>sin(&theta;)<sup>2</sup> + cos(&theta;)<sup>2</sup> = 1</code>.
