        <h2>The Non-Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
        <p align="center">
          <i>"The area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to<br>the sum of the areas of the squares on the other
            two sides"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although no writings of Pythagoras have ever been discovered, other ancient writers such as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_new">Plato</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" target="_new">Herodotus</a> wrote extensively about his
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the period of the Roman Republic, he was already held in high regard as a philosopher and mathematician, by
          which time, this relationship had already been attributed to him &mdash; in spite of the fact that it had been
          widely known for at least 1000 years before his birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the earliest documents known to record this relationship is the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Papyrus_6619" target="_new">Berlin Papyrus 6619</a> written in
          Ancient Egypt during the 13th Dynasty (1803 - 1649 BC).
        </p>
        <p>
          All that to say, as you drag point `C` around the circle, you'll see that if you add up the areas of the two
          green squares, they will <b><i>always</i></b> equal the area of the blue square.

        <h2>The Origin of a Trigonometric Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Since we have decided to assign this circle a radius (hypotenuse) of one unit, the definitions of
          `sin(&theta;)` and `cos(&theta;)` can be reduced simply to
          `sin(&theta;)` = height and `cos(&theta;)` = width.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that the areas of the various squares shown above will be:
        <ul>
          <li>The square on the radius (hypotenuse) has an area always equal to 1</li>
          <li>The square opposite the angle has an area equal to the height squared which is the same as
            `sin(&theta;)^2`
          </li>
          <li>The square adjacent to the angle has an area equal to the width squared which is the same as
            `cos(&theta;)^2`
          </li>
        </ul>
        We now have a simple, visual demonstration of the trigonometric identity
        `sin(&theta;)^2 + cos(&theta;)^2 = 1`.

        <h2>That Other Famous Greek, Sohcahtoa</h2>
        <p>
          Only kidding, Sohcahtoa was not a famous Greek mathematician: in fact it's not even a person&hellip; &#128515;<br>
          Instead, the word SOHCAHTOA is an acronym design to help you remember how the trigonometric ratios of sine,
          cosine and tangent are calculated.

          This simply means that the size of the angle `&theta;` is directly related to the ratio of the sides of a
          right-angled triangle.
          If you know one of these ratios, then you also know the angle.
          Similarly, if you know the angle, then you can calculate any one of these ratios.

              The length of side <b>opposite</b> the angle `&theta;` divided by the length of the <b>hypotenuse</b>

            <p>
              Hence SOH: <b>S</b>ine = <b>O</b>pposite over <b>H</b>ypotenuse
