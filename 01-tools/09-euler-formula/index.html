          Previously, we saw that `e^x`, `sin(&theta;)` and `cos(&theta;)` can all be written as Maclaurin series, and

          these series are very similar.

        <p>
          Taking what we know about the cycle of values created when we raise `i` to increasing powers, we can now write
          the Maclaurin series for `e^(ix)`.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, wherever an `x` appears in the expansion of `e^x`, we will now write `ix`.
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/(2!) + (x^3)/(3!) + (x^4)/(4!) + (x^5)/(5!) + ...`
        </p>
        <p>
          becomes
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(ix) = 1 + ix + (ix)^2/(2!) + (ix)^3/(3!) + (ix)^4/(4!) + (ix)^5/(5!) + ...`
        </p>
        <p>
          Remembering that `i^2 = -1`, `i^3 = -i` and `i^4 = 1`, we can reduce the various powers of `i` down to their
          simplest form
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(ix) = 1 + ix - x^2/(2!) - (ix^3)/(3!) + x^4/(4!) + (ix^5)/(5!) + ...`
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now see that all the terms raised to an even power have no `i` in them, and all the terms raised to an
          odd power do have an `i` but with alternating signs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we can rearrange the terms to group all the even and odd powers together, then from the odd-power terms,
          we can factor out the `i`:
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(ix) = (1 - x^2/(2!) + x^4/(4!) - &hellip;) + i(x - (x^3)/(3!) + (x^5)/(5!) - &hellip;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Does this look familiar?
        </p>
        <p>
          All the even powered terms are the Maclaurin series for `cos(&theta;)` and all the odd powered terms are the
          Maclaurin series for `sin(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          So we can now take the last step and replace the groups of terms for their `sin` and `cos` equivalents:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x)`
        </p>
        <p>
          This is known as Euler's Formula.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of `i` in the formula is very important because it helps keep the various terms separate.
          Those terms that contribute towards the calculation of the cosine value do not have `i` in their definition,
          but those terms that contribute towards the calculation of the sine value do have `i` in them.
        </p>

        <h3>Euler's Identity - A Special Case of Euler's Formula</h3>
        <p>
          Previously, we saw that if you draw an arc around the circumference of a circle whose length equals exactly
          one radius, then the angle you have created is known as 1 radian (about `57.3&deg;`).
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes radians so useful is that we are now measuring rotation in multiples of `pi` &mdash; there are `2
          pi` radians in a full circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see what happens to Euler's formula if we set `x = pi` radians (that is, we're measuring a half
          rotation).
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(i pi) = cos(pi) + i sin(pi)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, `cos(pi) = -1` and secondly, `sin(pi) = 0`, so the `sin` term disappears and we get:
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(i pi) = -1`
        </p>
        <p>
          Now add `1` to both sides, and we get Euler's famous identity:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          `e^(i pi) + 1 = 0`
        </p>
        <p>
          This formula has been described as one of the most beautiful in all of mathematics because it shows how the 5
          most fundamental constants are related:
        <ul>
          <li>`e` - The natural base</li>
          <li>`i` - The square root of `-1`</li>
          <li>`pi` - The ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference</li>
          <li>`1` - The fundamental counting unit</li>
          <li>`0` - The midpoint of the real number line</li>
        </ul>
