              <p>
                Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783) was a Swiss mathematician who is generally regarded as one of the most
                brilliant mathematicians ever to have lived.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming from the city of Basel in a German speaking region of Switzerland, his last name is pronounced
                "oiler", not "yooler".
              </p>
              <p>
                The number that now bears Leonhard Euler's name was not in fact derived by him; instead, it was derived
                by another Swiss mathematician, <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli#Discovery_of_the_mathematical_constant_e">Jacob
                  Bernoulli</a> (1655 - 1705).
              </p>
              <p>
                Bernoulli was investigating the nature of compound interest and discovered that no matter how many
                intervals you divide a year into, when calculating compound interest for each of those intervals, the
                original sum will never grow by more than a factor of `2.718`.
              </p>
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <img
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg/220px-Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg" />
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          The formula Bernoulli discovered for calculating this limit is `(1 + 1/n)^n` where `n` is the number of
          intervals at which compound interest is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, over the period of a year, if you calculate interest once every month, `n` would be `12`, and the growth
          factor is `2.613`.
          Change `n` to 24 and the growth factor rises to `2.664`.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key point here is to realise that as `n` becomes larger and larger, you are calculating the `n`th exponent
          of a number that becomes closer and closer to (but never reaches) `1`.
          This in turn, means that the answer comes closer and closer to (but never exceeds) a maximum value of `2.718`.
        </p>
        <p>
          To 30 decimal places, this value is `2.718281828459045235360287471352`
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an example of a converging infinite series.
        </p>

        <h3>Infinite Series for `e`</h3>
        <p>
          However, it was Leonhard Euler who demonstrated that the same limit could be calculated using a simpler
          infinite series.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formula Euler derived is this: `e = sum_(n=0)^oo 1/(n!)` and when he used the number this calculation
          produces, he assigned it the letter `e`.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not familiar with this notation, here's how to understand it:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The capital Greek letter sigma `sum_` means "summation"; so we immediately know we will have to add up a
              sequence
              of numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
              But which numbers?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Below the capital sigma, we can see `n=0` and above, we see the symbol for infinity `oo`.
              This defines the limits of our range: `n` starts at `0` and goes all the way up to infinity&hellip;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next, we see the formula `1/(n!)`<br>
              This formula tells us how to calculate each term in the series: all we have to do is replace `n` with the
              next value in the sequence.

                    You might be wondering how the first term evaluates to `1` when `n=0`.<br>
                    This is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial#Factorial_of_zero"
                      target="_new">`0! = 1`</a>.

          However, in practical terms, it is completely impossible to add up an infinite series of numbers, so we'll
          just add up enough terms to give us a sufficiently accurate value to work with.
          This is called a <i>partial sum</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Infinite Series for `e^x`</h3>
        <p>
          More generally, if you wish to calculate `e` raised to some power `x`, then the formula is very similar:
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^x = sum_(n=0)^oo (x^n)/(n!)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Which expands out to `e^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/(2!) + (x^3)/(3!) + (x^4)/(4!) + (x^5)/(5!) + ...`
