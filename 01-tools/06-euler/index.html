                Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783) was a Swiss mathematician who is generally regarded as one of the most
                brilliant mathematicians ever to have lived.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming from the city of Basel in a German speaking region of Switzerland, his last name is pronounced
                "oiler", not "yooler".
              </p>
              <p>
                The number that now bears Leonhard Euler's name was not in fact derived by him; instead, it was derived
                by another Swiss mathematician, <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli#Discovery_of_the_mathematical_constant_e">Jacob
                  Bernoulli</a> (1655 - 1705).
              </p>
              <p>
                Bernoulli was investigating the nature of compound interest and discovered that no matter how many times
                you calculate compound interest during the year, the original sum will never grow by more than a factor
                of 2.718
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg/220px-Leonhard_Euler_-_Jakob_Emanuel_Handmann_%28Kunstmuseum_Basel%29.jpg" />

        <p>
          The formula for calculating this limit is `(1 + 1/n)^n` where `n` is the number of times when compound
          interest is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you calculated interest once every month, `n` would be `12`, and the growth factor is `2.613`.
          Change `n` to 24 and the growth factor rises to `2.664`.
          Bernoulli's insight was to realise that as `n` grows to infinity, so the result approaches, but never exceeds
          `2.718`.
          This is an example of a limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          To 30 decimal places, this value is `2.718281828459045235360287471352`
        </p>
        <h3>Infinite Series for `e`</h3>
        <p>
          However, it was Leonhard Euler who demonstrated that the same limit could be calculated using an infinite
          series.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formula Euler derived is this: `e = sum_(n=0)^oo 1/(n!)`
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not familiar with this notation, here's how to understand it:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The capital Greek letter sigma means "summation"; so we immediately know we will have to add up some
            numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Below the capital sigma, we can see `n=0` and above, we see the symbol for infinity `oo`.
            This tells us the starting and ending numbers for each term in the series &mdash; which in this case goes on
            for ever&hellip;
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, we see the formula `1/(n!)`<br>
            This formula tells us how to calculate each term in the series: all we have to do is replace `n` with the
            next value in the sequence.
            So we get the value of the first term by setting `n=0`, then to that, we add the value when `n=1`, then to
            that, we add the value when `n=2`, then `n=3`, then `n=4` and&hellip; You get the idea.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

          However, in practical terms, it is completely impossible to add up an infinite series of numbers, so we'll
          just do the best we can by adding up the first few terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          `e = 1/(0!) + 1/(1!) + 1/(2!) + 1/(3!) + 1/(4!) + 1/(5!) + ...`
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're wondering what the `!` after the number means, this is the factorial symbol.
        </p>
        <p>
          So `n! = n xx (n-1) xx (n-2) xx (n-3) xx ... xx 2 xx 1`<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also be wondering how, if the first value of `n` is `0`, why the first term in the series is `1`
          and not `0`.
          This is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial#Factorial_of_zero" target="_new">`0! = 1`</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          So when fully expanded, the first six terms of the summation series looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          `e = 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + 1/120 + ...`
        </p>
        <h3>Infinite Series for `e^x`</h3>
        <p>
          More generally, if you wish to calculate `e` raised to some power `x`, then the formula is very similar:
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^x = sum_(n=0)^oo (x^n)/(n!)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Which expands out to `e^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/(2!) + (x^3)/(3!) + (x^4)/(4!) + (x^5)/(5!) + ...`
        </p>
