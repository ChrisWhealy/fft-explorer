        <p>
          Up until now, we have only spoken about two of a wave's three fundamental properties: frequency and phase.
          However, we now need to look at the third property called amplitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the graph below, point `P` is fixed at 60&deg; relative to when the wave crosses the Y axis.
          As you change the sliders, notice how the amplitude of point `P` changes in both the positive an negative
          direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Frequency</h3>
        <p>
          Frequency describes how many times the wave oscillates up and down within a given period of time.<br>
          The standard period of time is 1 second, and the units are cycles per second, or Hz.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase</h3>
        <p>
          Phase describes where in the up and down cycle some point on a wave has reached.
        </p>

        <h3>Amplitude</h3>
        <p>
          Amplitude measures the overall height of a wave; in other words, it measures the difference between a wave's
          positive and negative peaks.
