        <h2>Phase</h2>
        <p>
          The sine and cosine waves are an examples of "periodic functions".
        </p>
        <p>
          To say that something is "periodic" means that it does the same thing over and over again.
          For example, the hands on a clock are periodic &mdash; they just go round and round pointing at the same 12
          hours over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          To say that a mathematical function is periodic means that no matter what sequence of numbers you put into it,
          it will give you back a corresponding set of numbers that form a never ending cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first lesson <a href="/sine-cosine/index.html">Where do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a>, we saw
          how a wave can be generated by tracing how the distance of a point on the circumference of a circle changes in
          relation to the X and Y axes, as that point spins around forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          How far up or down a wave is in this cycle is known as the wave's <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)" targe="_new">phase</a>, and when two waves of the same
          frequency do not line up with each other, that difference isknown as <b>phase shift</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualising Phase Shift</h2>
        <p>
          In the graph below, we have two sine waves of the same frequency.
          This means that both waves rise and fall at exactly the same rate, but not necessarily at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By moving the point `C` around the circumference of the circle, you can see how rotation and phase shift
          are two different ways of looking at the same phenomenon.
          As you move point `C`, the corresponding point `P` moves and allows you to read the phase shift of the two
          waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          When point `C` is sitting on the positive X axis, the two waves rise and fall exactly in sync with each other,
          so they are said to be <b>in phase</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you move the point around to sit, say on the positive Y axis, the two waves now rise and fall at different
          times and are said to be <b>out of phase</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When point `C` rests exactly on the negative X axis, the two waves now rise and fall in exact opposition to
          each other &mdash; they are now said to be in <b>anti-phase</b>.

        <h2>Phase Relationship Between Sine and Cosine</h2>
        <p>
          If you move point `C` to rest exactly on the positive Y axis, the blue sine wave now crosses the Y axis at
          `+1` and the green sine wave crosses the Y axis at `0`.
        </p>
        <p>
          By shifting a sine wave by 90&deg; you have turned it into a cosine wave of the same frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we now think of the blue wave above as a cosine wave, then we can see that:<br>
          <br>
          `cos(&theta;) = sin(&theta; + 90)`<br>
          or<br>
          `sin(&theta;) = cos(&theta; - 90)`

        <h2>Phase Shift as Time</h2>
        <p>
          Another way to think of phase shift is in terms of time &mdash; one wave is offset from another by a certain
          number of milleseconds. However, in order to express phase shift in terms of time, we need to know how rapidly
          that wave is going up and down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first lesson <a href="/sine-cosine/index.html">Where do Sine and Cosine Waves Come From?</a> we saw a
          point rotating around the circumference of a circle in an anti-clockwise direction.
          Now need to know how fast that point is going around.
        </p>
        <p>
          This speed of oscillation is known as the wave's "frequency" and it has the unit `Hz` named after the German
          physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz">Heinrich Hertz</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say that this point is spinning around the circle 100 times per second: that is, one rotation every 10
          milleseconds.
          So on the graph above, the horzontal axis displays degrees of rotation (from 0&deg; to 360&deg;), but we now
          know that scale can also represent time &mdash; in our example, 0&deg; to 360&deg; equals 10 milleseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we know for a wave of a particular frequency `f`, that it has rotated through an angle &theta;, then we
          can calculate how much time that took using the formula:<br>
          `t=&theta;/(f xx 360&deg;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          So for a wave that has a frequency of 100Hz, a phase shift of 90&deg; corresponds to a time delay of:
        </p>
        <p>
          `t=(90&deg;)/(100 xx 360&deg;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          `t=2.5ms`
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we could rearrange this formula to calculate the angle `&theta;` given the frequency `f` and the
          time `t`:<br>
          `&theta;=t xx f xx 360&deg;`
