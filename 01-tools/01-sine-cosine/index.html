        <p>
          You may have been taught in school that "sine" or "cosine" are something to do with calculating the angles
          inside a triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe you were just in the room when mathematics was being taught&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the heart of the matter is that this right-angled triangle you learnt about in school is simply a
          tool for
          understanding rotation and is constructed inside a circle where the triangle's longest side is the circle's
          radius.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this, let's draw a circle with a radius of one unit whose centre (point `O`) is located at the
          origin of some coordinate system. Next, we mark a point `C` where the circumference of the circle crosses the
          positive X axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the radius of the circle slowly rotates, the point `C` on the circumference forms the apex of a
          right-angled
          triangle with the X and Y axes where the height is the line `CH` and the width is the line `CW`.
        </p>
        <p>
          As point `C` moves around the circle, the point `W` moves up and down the Y axis, and point `H` moves left and
          right along the X axis.
          The key point to understand here is that the height (line `CH`) and width (line `CW`) change in a fixed ratio
          that is exactly proportional to the angle of rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graphs to the right of and below the circle trace a wave shape that describes how the height and width of
          the triangle vary with the angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also notice that a sine wave and a cosine wave have exactly the same shape; the only difference being that
          when the angle is zero, the sine wave has a value of zero, but the cosine wave has a value of one.

        <h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>
        <p>
          The trigonometric functions such as "sine", "cosine" and "tangent" are simply the names given to the ratios of
          the lengths of the sides inside this triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all of these examples, we have arbitrarily defined our circle to have a radius of `1`, so calculations
          involving the length of the hypotenuse disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
          Always remember that first and foremost, these trigonometric functions describe rotation around a circle with
          a radius of `1`.
          The triangles we talk about here exist simply as a tool for calculating how the position of a point rotating
          around the circumference of the circle changes relative to the X and Y axes.
        </p>

        <h3>Sine</h3>
        <p>
          "Sine" is name given to the ratio of the triangle's height (`CH`) to its radius (`OC`).
        </p>
        <p>
          This ratio varies from `-1` to `+1`.
        </p>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <p>
                So when we calculate
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                  <mfrac>
                    <mtext>height</mtext>
                    <mtext>radius</mtext>
                  </mfrac>
                </math>
                that ratio is known as the sine of the angle `&theta;` or `sin(&theta;)`.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or, to use the more conventional names
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                  <mrow>

        <p>
          Therefore, if we know the sine of an angle, we can turn that fraction back into an angle using the
          inverse sine function: `&theta; = sin^-1 (value)`. (Also written `arcsin()`)

          "Cosine" is name given to the ratio of the triangle's width (`CW`) to its radius (`OC`).

          Lastly, "tangent" is the name given to the ratio of the triangle's height `CH` to its width `CW`.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tangent value varies from `-&infin;` to `+&infin;`.
