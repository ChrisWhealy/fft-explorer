          The most widespread unit for measuring rotation is degrees (indicated by a small circle &deg; written to the
          top right of a number).
          A full circle is divided into 360 degrees, so a half turn is 180 degrees, and quarter turn is 90 degrees etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact reason for why there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">360 degrees in a
            circle</a> is unclear, but it is most likely related to the fact that there are approximately 360 days in a
          year, and the Ancient Babylonians used both a 360 day calendar and a base 60 (or sexagesimal) counting system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, 360 is also a very convenient number for calculation because, except for 7 and 11, it is evenly
          divisible by
          every number between 2 and 12.

                It has been known since antiquity that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is a value
                just
                over 3 &mdash; although arriving at a precise value turned out to be quite tricky.
              </p>
              <p>
                This ratio is identified by the Greek letter `pi` or Pi and for many practical purposes, is taken to
                equal
                `22/7`.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though we cannot calculate its exact value, this ratio crops up so frequently (and sometimes
                unexpectedly), that it becomes very convenient to define rotation in units of `pi`.

                A radian is a unit of rotation and is defined by creating an arc around a circle, such that the length
                of the arc equals the radius of the circle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing that the diameter divides into the circumference `pi` times, and that the diameter is twice the
                length of the radius, we can write `c = pi d = 2 pi r`.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we create an angle whose arc length equals one radius, then there will be `2pi` such angles in the
                length
                of the circumference, that is, in one full rotation.
