                When have seen that when you raise `i` to successive integer powers, we get a cycle of values
                `1 -> i -> -1 -> -i -> 1 -> i &hellip;`
              </p>
              <p>
                When plotted on a graph, these values rotate in an anti-clockwise direction.
                However, the graph being used here represents a plane where the coordinates for every point are composed
                from both a real number (plotted horizontally on the X axis) and an imaginary number (plotted vertically
                on the Y axis).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is called the <b><i>"Complex Plane"</i></b>, and any point on the complex plane is identified by a
                <b><i>Complex Number</i></b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The simplest way to represent the above set of rotating values is to use (X,Y) coordinates like this:

        <h2>Different Ways to Represent a Complex Number</h2>
        <h3>Cartesian (or Rectangular) Form</h3>
        <p>
          When a complex number is expressed as a pair of values such as `4 + 3i`, we are identifying the point on the
          complex plane in terms of an (X,Y) pair of coordinates.
          In other words `4 + 3i` tells you to <i>"Start at the origin facing east, then take four steps forward, turn
            90&deg; to the left, then take three more steps"</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This representation is known as the Cartesian or Rectangular Form because the point is described in terms of
          the lengths of two sides of a right triangle.
        </p>
        <h3>Polar Form</h3>
        <p>
          But can't we just walk in a straight line from the origin directly to the point?
        </p>
        <p>
          We certainly can, but first we need to know both how far we should walk, and second we need to know in which
          direction. (The convention here is that 0&deg; is the direction of the positive X axis, and positive rotation
          is anti-clockwise).
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with the complex number `4 + 3i`, we know this describes a right-angled triangle with a base of
          length `4` and a height of length `3`.
          So using the theorem that Pythagoras did not discover, we know that the length of the hypotenuse will be the
          square root of the sum of the other two lengths squared.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="/img/pythagoras.png" />
            </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <p>
                `h = sqrt (4^2 + 3^2)`<br>
                `h = sqrt (25)`<br>
                `h = 5`
              </p>
              <p>
                So, starting from the origin, we know we have to walk for a distance of `5` steps.
                We should also bear in mind that all the relationships we're using here are derived from the angles
                formed inside a circle.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means that the `5` steps we will be taking are along the radius of a circle &mdash; but in which
                direction?
              </p>

            <td colspan="3">
              <p>
                The direction in which we need to walk can be calculated by remembering the acronym SOHCAHTOA.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="/img/tan-theta.png" />
            </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <p>
                The last three letters "TOA" remind us that `tan(&theta;) = (opposite) / (adjacent)`
              </p>
              <p>
                `tan(&theta;) = 3/4`<br>
                `&theta; = arctan(3/4)`<br>
                `&theta; = 36.87&deg;`<br>
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          So the polar coordinates for the point `4 + 3i` are `(5, 36.87&deg;)`
        </p>
        <h3>Exponential Form</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, we have the exponential form that can be derived directly from Euler's Formula.
        </p>
        <p>
          `e^(i&theta;) = cos(&theta;) + i sin(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Remembering what we said earlier about circles, we should remember that the expression of Euler's Formula
          shown above is for a circle with a radius of `1`.
          To extend this formula to handle a circle of any radius `r`, we must include a term for the radius:
        </p>
        <p>
          `r e^(i&theta;) = r(cos(&theta;) + i sin(&theta;))`
        </p>
        <p>
          In our example, `&theta; = 36.87&deg;` and `r = 5`, so `4 + 3i` expressed in exponential form is
          `5e^(36.87&deg;i)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we should also note that the angle has been expressed in degrees rather than the more usual radians.
        </p>
        <p>
          To convert degrees to radians, we must multiply the angle in degrees by `pi` then divide by `180`.
        </p>
        <p>
          `(36.87&deg; xx pi)/ 180 = 0.644`
        </p>
        <p>
          So using radians, `4 + 3i` expressed in exponential form is `5e^(0.644i)`
        </p>
        <p>
          In the graph below, the red dot starts at location `4 + 3i`.
          As you drag it around, you will see its value in the three different representations change.
