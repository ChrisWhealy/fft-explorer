        <p>
          As we have just stated, our familiar arithmetic operations such as addition or division apply only to real
          numbers; so when we try to combine real numbers with imaginary numbers, the familiar rules of arithmetic
          simply break.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in `3 + sqrt (-1)`, how much bigger does `3` become after adding `sqrt (-1)`?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a question we simply cannot answer because real and imaginary numbers don't play nicely together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only operation that can begin to handle `sqrt (-1)` is multiplication, but even then, we can only fully
          calculate values that multiply an even number of `i`'s together.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of these limitations, we can still perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Addition</h2>
        <p>
          Adding two complex numbers such as `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is simply a matter of adding the real parts
          together,
          then adding the imaginary parts.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4 + 3i) + (1 - 2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`(4 + 1) + (3i + -2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`5 + i`</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <div id="complexAddBox" class="complexAddBox"></div>

        <h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <p>
          Subtracting two complex numbers such as `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is simply a matter of subtracting the second
          real part from the first real part, then subtracting the second imaginary part from the first imaginary part.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4 + 3i) - (1 - 2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`(4 - 1) + (3i - -2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`3 + 5i`</td>

        <h2>Multiplication</h2>
        <p>
          Multiplying two complex numbers such `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is a little more involved.
          There are several ways for performing multiplication, and here we will show two different approaches: the FOIL
          method and the area method.
          Hopefully, one will make intuitive sense to you.

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <h3>The FOIL Method</h3>
              <p>
                FOIL is an acronym for <b>F</b>irst, <b>O</b>utside, <b>I</b>nside, <b>L</b>ast that helps you remember
                the order in which terms are to be multiplied.

              <h3>The Area Method</h3>
              <p>
                Another way of thinking of complex numbers is to represent the real and complex parts on the sides of a
                rectangle.
              </p>

              <p>
                In our case, `(2 + 3i) ** (1 - 2i)` would be written like this:
              </p>
              <p>
                We now have 4 individual rectangles whose areas are easy to calculate.
                The total area is then simply the sum of the areas of the 4 smaller rectangles.
              </p>

        <h2>Division</h2>
        <p>
          The basic problem with complex division is that our rules of arithmetic are unable to tell us how many times
          the imaginary number `sqrt (-1)` divides into a real number.
          So if we encounter a term such as `3/(2i)`, then we're completely stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Descartes all those years ago, we can't seem to make that pesky `sqrt (-1)` go away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or can we?
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick here is to perform the division in such a way that we are left only with a real value in the
          denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we have a division such as `(4 + 3i)/(2-i)`, how do we go about getting rid of the `-i` in `(2-i)`?
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Complex Conjugate</h3>
        <p>
          When you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, all the `i`'s go away!
          And it is formed simply by reversing the sign of the imaginary term.
          So the complex conjugate of `(3+4i)` is simply `(3-4i)`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see what happens when we multiply `(3+4i)` by its conjugate `(3-4i)`
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Using the area method, we separate the two complex numbers into their real and imaginary parts.
            </td>
            <td><img src="/img/Conjugate1.png"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Multiply the row and column values together&hellip;
            </td>
            <td><img src="/img/Conjugate2.png"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              When we add up all 4 values, we can see that the two imaginary parts cancel out, leaving only `9 + 16`
            </td>
            <td><img src="/img/Conjugate3.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          So `(3+4i) ** (3-4i) = 25`
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, that's nice, but how does it help us with division?
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Use The Conjugate To Make the `i`s Go Away</h3>
        <p>
          The trick is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
        </p>
        <p>
          `(4+3i)/(2-i) xx (2+i)/(2+i)`
        </p>
        <p>
          This has the same effect as multiplying by `1`, but we're doing so in a way that removes the imaginary term
          from the denominator leaving only the real term.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4+3i) / (2-i)`</td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>

            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`((4+3i) xx (2+i)) / 5`</td>
