        <p>
          Let's face it, many of our familiar arithmetic operations such as addition or division simply break when we
          try to perform calculations involving `sqrt (-1)`.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in `3 / (sqrt (-1))`, how many times does `sqrt (-1)` go into `3`?
        </p>
        <p>
          The only operation that can begin to handle `sqrt (-1)` is multiplication, but even then, we can only fully
          calculate values that multiply an even number of `i`'s together.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of these limitations, we still need to know how to perform arithmetic using complex numbers.
        </p>

        <h2>Addition</h2>
        <p>
          Adding two complex numbers such as `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is simply a matter of adding the real parts together,
          then adding the imaginary parts.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4 + 3i) + (1 - 2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`(4 + 1) + (3i + -2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`5 + i`</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <div id="complexAddBox" class="complexAddBox"></div>

        <h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <p>
          Subtracting two complex numbers such as `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is simply a matter of subtracting the second
          real part from the first real part, then subtracting the second imaginary part from the first imaginary part.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4 + 3i) - (1 - 2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`(4 - 1) + (3i - -2i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`3 + 5i`</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <div id="complexSubtractBox" class="complexSubtractBox"></div>

        <h2>Multiplication</h2>
        <p>
          Multiplying two complex numbers such `(4 + 3i)` and `(1 - 2i)` is a little more involved because we must follow
          the FOIL rule.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <p>
                FOIL is an acronym for <b>F</b>irst, <b>O</b>utside, <b>I</b>nside, <b>L</b>ast that helps you remember
                the order in which terms are to be multiplied.
              </p>
              <table class="eq-sequence">
                <tr>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>`(3 + 2i) * (1 - 2i)`</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>`=>`</td>
                  <td>`(3 * 1) + (3 * -2i) + (2i * 1) + (2i * -2i)`</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>`=>`</td>
                  <td>`3 - 6i + 2i - 4i^2`</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>`=>`</td>
                  <td>`3 - 6i + 2i + 4`</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>`=>`</td>
                  <td>`7 - 4i`</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
            </td>
            <td>
              <img src="/img/FOIL.png" />
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <div id="complexMultBox" class="complexMultBox"></div>

        <h2>Division</h2>
        <p>
          The basic problem with complex division is that our rules of arthmetic are unable to tell us how many times
          `sqrt (-1)` divides into a real number.
          So if we encounter a term such as `3/(2i)`, then we're completely stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Descartes all those years ago, we can't seem to make that pesky `sqrt (-1)` go away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or can we?
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick here is to perform the division in such a way that we are left only with a real value in the
          denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we have a division such as `(4 + 3i)/(2-i)`, how do we go about getting rid of the `-i` in `(2-i)`?
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Complex Conjugate</h3>
        <p>
          When you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, all the `i`'s go away!
          And it is formed simply by reversing the sign of the imaginary term.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the complex conjugate of `(3+4i)` is simply `(3-4i)`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see what happens when we multiply `(3+4i)` by its conjugate `(3-4i)`
        </p>
        <p>
          By applying the FOIL rule, we get:
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(3+4i) * (3-4i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`(3 * 3) + (3 * -4i) + (3 * 4i) + (4i * -4i)`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`9 - 12i + 12i - 16i^2`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`9 + 16`</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`25`</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Ok, that's nice, but how does it help us with division?
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Use The Conjugate To Make the `i`s Go Away</h3>
        <p>
          The trick is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
        </p>
        <p>
          `(4+3i)/(2-i) xx (2+i)/(2+i)`
        </p>
        <p>
          This has the same effect as multiplying by `1`, but we're doing so in a way that removes the imaginary term
          from the denominator leaving only the real term.
        </p>
        <table class="eq-sequence">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>`(4+3i) / (2-i)`</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`((4+3i) xx (2+i)) / ((2-i) xx (2+i))`</td>
            <td>Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>`=>`</td>
            <td>`((4+3i) xx (2+i)) / 5`</td>
            <td>Apply the FOIL rule to the denominator &mdash; which reduces it to a real number</td>
