          <b>To Convole</b>: from the Latin <i>convolvere</i> meaning <i>con</i> = "with" + <i>volvere</i> = "to roll,
          twist or rotate".
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, to "convolve" literally means to "roll or twist together".
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of audio processing, convolution is the process of examining a signal in order to discover not
          only the individual sine waves from which it is composed, but also what contribution each of those sine waves
          make in terms of phase and amplitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done by taking the signal and "rolling it together" with a set of test waves (over some range of
          frequencies) in such a way that the output tells us to what degree the test wave is present in the signal.

        <h2>Measuring Out-of-Phaseness</h2>
        <p>
          Assuming that "out-of-phaseness" is even a word, we will start with the simplest case in which the signal and
          test wave both have exactly the same frequency (5Hz), amplitude and phase alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our signal is the green wave and the phase shift slider controls a blue test wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you move the slider left and right, you are shifting the phase of the blue test wave relative to the
          signal.
          When the slider is at 0&deg;, the two waves are "in phase" (I.E. they line up perfectly), but when the slider
          is at 180&deg;, the two waves are in anti-phase (I.E. they are perfectly mis-aligned).
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to quantify the degree of misalignment between these two waves, we have to "convolve" the signal with
          the test wave.
          What this means is that for each point from 0&deg; to 360&deg; on the test wave, we will take its value and
          multiply it by the corresponding value on the signal wave.
        </p>

      <td class="description">
        <div id="wavesBox" class="wavesBox"></div>
        <p>
          As you can see, we get another sine wave that always has an amplitude of `1`, but whose position swings both
          left and right, and up and down depending on the degree of phase shift.
        </p>
        <p>
        <div id="convBox" class="convBox"></div>
        </p>
        <p>
          The final step of the calculation is work out the area under the graph shaded in red.
          The red shaded area straddles the X axis, so the area above cancels out the area below.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we add up these areas, we get a total that varies depending on the phase of the test wave relative to the signal.
        </p>
        <p>
        <div id="areaBox" class="convBox"></div>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          The pseudo-code to calculate this area looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript" id="beautifiedCode"></code></pre> -->
        <p>
          Effectively, this code calculates the integral of the convolution curve from 0&deg; to 360&deg;
        </p>

        <h2>But What Does This Tell Us?</h2>
        <p>
          What we learn from this is that when the area under the graph reaches a maximum, not only have we discovered
          that the signal contains the test frequency, but we have also discovered the phase relationship between these
          two waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, the maximum area of `180` is reached at `0&deg;` of phase shift.
