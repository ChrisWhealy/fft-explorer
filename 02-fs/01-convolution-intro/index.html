          <b>To Convolve</b>: from the Latin <i>convolvere</i> meaning <i>con</i> = "with" + <i>volvere</i> = "to roll
          or
          twist".
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, to "convolve" literally means to "roll or twist together".
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of audio processing, convolution is the process of examining a signal in order to discover not
          only the individual sine waves from which it is composed, but also what contribution each of those sine waves
          make in terms of phase and amplitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done by taking the signal and "rolling it together" with a set of test waves (over some range of
          frequencies) in such a way that the output tells us to what degree the test wave is present in the signal.

        <h2>Measuring Out-of-Phaseness</h2>
        <p>
          Assuming that "out-of-phaseness" is even a word, we will start with the simplest case in which the signal and
          test wave both have exactly the same frequency (5Hz), amplitude and phase alignment.

          The the graph below, the signal is the blue wave and the phase shift slider controls a red test wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you move the slider left and right, you are shifting the phase of the red test wave relative to the
          signal.
          When the slider is at 0&deg;, the two waves are "in phase" (I.E. they line up perfectly), but when the slider
          is at 180&deg;, the two waves are in anti-phase (I.E. they are perfectly mis-aligned).

        <h4>Convolution Curve</h4>
        <p>
          In order to quantify the degree of misalignment between these two waves, we have to "convolve" the signal with
          the test wave.
          What this means is that for each point from 0&deg; to 360&deg; on the test wave, we will take its value and
          multiply it by the corresponding value on the signal wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, we get another sine wave whose amplitude matches the test wave's amplitude, but whose position
          swings both up and down, and left and right depending on how far the test wave has been phase shifted.

        <h4>Integral of the Convolution Curve</h4>
        <p>
          The final step is to calculate the area of the green shaded section under the convolution curve.
          In other words, we need to calculate the integral of the convolution curve between 0&deg; and 360&deg;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph to the right shows how the area under the convolution wave varies depending on the phase and
          amplitude of the test wave.
