        <h2>When the Test Wave Is Not Contained Within The Signal</h2>
        <p>
          Now let's look at what happens when the test wave does not match any frequency in the signal.
          Firstly, this means that the signal needs to contain multiple frequencies, and secondly, we need to be able to
          change the frequency of the test wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue graph below shows a signal that is composed of three sine waves; 6Hz, 9Hz and 11Hz.
          To keep things simple, each of these frequencies is present at equal magnitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now as you change the frequency of the test wave, you'll notice that the integral point stays at (or very
          close to) zero.
          When the slider is at 0&deg;, the two waves are "in phase" (I.E. they line up perfectly), but when the slider
          is at 180&deg;, the two waves are in anti-phase (I.E. they are perfectly mis-aligned).

        <p>
          When the frequency of the test wave is set to any value other than 6Hz, 9Hz or 11Hz, notice that the integral
          of the convolution curves stays at (or very close to) zero
        </p>
        <p>
          When the test frequency is set to exactly 6Hz, 9Hz or 11Hz, then the integral jumps up to some large value:
          about `60` in this case.
