        <h2>Adjusting the Test Wave To Discover Component Frequencies Within the Signal</h2>
        <p>
          Now let's look at what happens when the test wave does not match any frequency in the signal.
          Firstly, this means that the signal needs to contain multiple frequencies, and secondly, we need to be able to
          change the frequency of the test wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue graph below shows a signal that is composed of three sine waves; 6Hz, 9Hz and 11Hz.
          To keep things simple, each of these frequencies is present at equal amplitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the test wave set to 5Hz, you'll notice that no matter how you change the test wave's phase, the integral
          of the convolution curve stays at (or very close to) zero.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now start changing the frequency of the test wave.
          Notice that as it approaches 6Hz, 9Hz or 11Hz, the integral of the convolution curve starts to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, as the frequency of the test wave diverges from 6Hz, 9Hz, or 11Hz, then the integral stays at
          (or very close to) zero.

        <h3>What Does This Tell Us?</h3>
        <p>
          When we see a maximum in the integral of the convolution curve, this tells us three important things:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The signal contains a component equal to the frequency of the test wave.
          </li>
          <li>
            This component occurs at a phase equal to the phase shift of the test wave.
          </li>
          <li>
            The maximum value of the integral is proportional to the amplitude of this component within the signal.
          </li>
        </ol>
