                As soon as you read a statement like "negative frequency", your brain will probably rebel against the
                idea and reject it as complete nonsense because it appears to describe a physical impossibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, this would certainly be correct if you think I am trying to convince you that an object can
                oscillate at the rate of `-5` times per second.

          What would that even look like &mdash; is it moving backwards in time&hellip;?
        </p>
        <p>
          But before you hit the mental "Eject" button, consider the way sine and cosine waves are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circular plot below shows a point moving around the circumference of a unit circle.
          As it moves, it projects lines onto the X and Y axes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sine and cosine waves are created by plotting the vertical and horizontal positions of these projections.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in order for this to work, we have had to define two, somewhat arbitrary starting conditions:
        <ol>
          <li>0&deg; of rotation corresponds to the positive direction of the X axis</li>
          <li>Positive rotation moves in the anti-clockwise direction</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div id="circleBox" class="circleBox"></div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <div id="sineBox" class="sineBox"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <div id="cosineBox" class="cosineBox"></div>
      </td>
      <td class="description" style="vertical-align: top;">
        <h2>Rotating the Other Way</h2>
        <p>
          But what would happen to the sine and cosine waves if we decided to rotate in the opposite direction?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hit the Fowards/Backwards button and watch the effect this has on the trace of the sine and cosine waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nada. Nichts. Zip. Diddly Squat&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as we can observe out here "in the real world", the sine and cosine waves are not affected by the
          direction of rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since the mathematics defines rotation in the anti-clockwise direction as positive, if we then rotate in
          the opposite direction, we must necessarily represent that direction as negative &mdash; a distinction that
          exists only in the mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when the point is moving "backwards" around the circle, the speed at which it does so is what is meant by
          "negative frequency"; however, as you can see, this makes no material difference to the resulting sine or
          cosine waves.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Go Back to Euler's Formula</h2>
        <p>
          Remember from <a href="/01-tools/09-euler-formula/index.html">lesson 9 in section 1</a> we learnt that Euler's
          Formula is:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          `e^(i&theta;) = cos(&theta;) + i sin(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          This formula expresses a profound connection between exponential functions and trigonometric functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our current usage, we have assumed that the angle `&theta;` increases in the positive (I.E. anti-clockwise)
          direction.
          But what if we start to rotate in the opposite direction and `&theta;` becomes increasingly negative?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we now have:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          `e^(-i&theta;) = cos(-&theta;) + i sin(-&theta;)`
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="description" colspan="2">
        <p>
          However, we know that the `cos` function is symmetric about the Y axis, so `cos(-&theta;) = cos(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          We also know that `sin(-&theta;) = -sin(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we can rewrite the above relationship like this:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          `e^(-i&theta;) = cos(&theta;) - i sin(&theta;)`
        </p>

        <h3>A Conjugal Relationship</h3>
        <p>
          Remember from <a href="/01-tools/11-complex-arith/index.html" target="_new">lesson 11 in section 1</a> when we
          looked at performing arithmetic with complex numbers?
          In order to perform complex division, we first needed to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the
          complex conjugate of the denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now look at the above equation: `cos(&theta;) - i sin(&theta;)` is the conjugate of `cos(&theta;) + i sin(&theta;)`
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore `e^(-i&theta;)` is the conjugate of `e^(i&theta;)`
        </p>
