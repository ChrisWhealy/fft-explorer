        <h2>Radians: Another Way To Measure Angles</h2>
        <p>
          The most widespread way to measure rotation is to use degrees.
          A full circle is divided into 360 degrees, so a half turn is 180 degrees, and quarter turn is 90 degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact reason for why there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">360 degrees in a
            circle</a> is unclear, but it is most likely related to the fact that there are approximately 360 days in a
          year, and the Ancient Babylonians used both a 360 day calendar and a base 60 (or sexagesimal) counting system.
          It is also a very convenient number for calculating even subdivisions because, except for 7 and 11, it is
          evenly divisible by every number between 2 and 12.
        </p>
        <h3>Radians</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          It has been known since antiquity that the ratio of the
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mfrac>
              <mtext>circumference</mtext>
              <mtext>diameter</mtext>
            </mfrac>
          </math>
          equals a value just over 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though we cannot calculate its exact value, this ratio crops up in calculations so frequently (and
          sometimes unexpectedly), that it becomes very convenient to define rotation in terms of it.
          This ratio is identified by the Greek letter `pi` or Pi.
        </p>
        <p>
          A radian is a unit of rotation and is defined by creating an arc around a circle, such that the length of
          the arc equals the radius of the circle.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
          <img src="/img/radian.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we know that the diameter divides into the circumference `pi` times and that the diameter is twice
          the length of the radius, we can write
          <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <mi>c</mi>
            <mo>=</mo>
            <mtext>&#x03C0;</mtext>
            <mi>d</mi>
            <mo>=</mo>
            <mn>2</mn>
            <mtext>&#x03C0;</mtext>
            <mi>r</mi>
          </math>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we create an angle whose arc length equals one radius, then there will be `2pi` such angles in the length
          of the circumference, that is, in one full rotation.
