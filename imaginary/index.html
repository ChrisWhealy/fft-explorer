        <h2>Imaginary Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          The Renaissance was a period of intellectual awakening in which European thinkers rediscovered the classical
          literature of Greece and Rome.
          As a result of the Greeks being masters of geometry, European mathematicians inherited a conceptual framework
          in which a mathematical concept was not considered reliable unless you could offer a geometric proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          One powerful, but largely unspoken consequence of this approach was the assumption that if you could not draw
          your solution, then there was no solution.
          This is why Greek mathematicians widely rejected the idea that there could be a quantity called `zero`; it
          just seemed philosophically wrong: after all, how could you draw a line with a length of `zero`?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reservations such as these became embedded into European thinking and it took several centuries for them to be
          unlearnt.
          However, as the Renaissance slowly transformed into the Enlightenment, mathematicians discovered that this new
          algebraic notation offered a way to express proofs of more abstract concepts far more easily than remaining
          anchored to the older geometric approach.
        </p>
        <h3>Squares and Square Roots</h3>
        <p>
          When you multiply a number by itself, you said to have "squared" that number.
          Reversing this process is called "taking the square root".
          The point here is that when you square any of the normal counting numbers, the answer will always be positive:
        </p>
        <p>
          A positive number multipled by itself is positive: `2 xx 2 = 4`<br>
          And a negative number multipled by itself is also positive: `-3 xx -3 = 9`
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, when you take the square root of a number, you must remember that there are always two answers: one
          positive and the other negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          `sqrt 4 = pm 2`<br>`sqrt 9 = pm 3`
        </p>
        <p>
          For several centuries before Euler, mathematicians considered it impossible (or even morally wrong) to talk
          about the square root of a negative number.
          It was considered inconceivable for there to be a number that, when multiplied by itself, gave the answer
          `-1`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet these bizarre numbers simply would not go away &mdash; they kept haunting the solutions to cubic
          equations&hellip;
        </p>
        <h3>Making the Conceptual Leap</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental problem here was a conceptual one &mdash; if I can count to a number, then I can say something
          like <i>"I have three apples"</i>.
          The quantity three is a number we can count to.
          It represents a real, tangible quantity of physical objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what answer should we write when calculating `sqrt (-9)`?
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not `+3` and its not `-3`, but a `3` must be involved somewhere &mdash; and herein lies the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><i>There is a 3 here, but its not the sort of 3 you can count to.</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If this makes your brain hurt, then don't worry &mdash; you're in good company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematicians found the concept of <i>"a number you cannot count to"</i> deeply perplexing as there just
          doesn't seem to be an intuitive way to conceptualise such a quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can come close by rewriting `-9` as `9 xx -1`.
          Then at least we can calculate the square root of the positive part.
        </p>
        <p>
          `sqrt (9 xx -1)` simplifies to `3 xx sqrt (-1)`, but this is only a partial result because that pesky `sqrt
          (-1)` simply won't go away.
        </p>
        <p>
          What mathematicians struggled to accept was the idea that even though we have this strange quantity we cannot
          count to, it is still mathematically useful (in fact, it turns out to be essential).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_new">Ren&eacute; Descartes</a> was one of
          many mathematicians who found that he just could not make these perplexing quantities go away.
          So in his frustration (and no doubt, a certain degree of irritation), he gave these numbers the rather
          derogatory title of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number#History"
            target="_new">"imaginary"</a>
          because to him, they did not represent anything "real".
        </p>
        <p>
          It's unfortunate, but this name has stuck.
        </p>
        <h3>The <i>i</i>'s Have It</h3>
        <p>
          Given that these numbers have been labelled "imaginary", and that it would be a pain to continually
          write
          `sqrt (-1)` every time we want to refer to this quantity, we just use the letter `i`.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <p>
                When you multiply this imaginary number `i` by itself, depending on the number of multiplications you
                perform, the will answer alternate between a real number (that is, one you can count to such as `+1` or
                `-1`) and another imaginary number (such as `i` or `-i`).
              </p>
              <p>
                If we want to display such numbers on a graph, then the convention is to plot real numbers on the X
                axis,
                and imaginary numbers on the Y axis.
                Such a graph looks like the one to the right:
              </p>
              <p>
                When we now multiply `i` by itself an increasing number of times, we get the following cycle of values:
              </p>
              <p>
                `i^0 = 1`<br>
                `i^1 = i`<br>
                `i^2 = i xx i = -1`<br>
                `i^3 = i xx i xx i = -i`<br>
                `i^4 = i xx i xx i xx i = 1` (and we're back to one again)<br>
                `i^5 = i xx i xx i xx i xx i = i`
              </p>
